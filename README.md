# Sales Summary Application

This is a simple, single-page web application that displays a summary of sales data fetched from a `data.csv` file. It calculates the total sales from the 'sales' column within the CSV and presents it in a clean, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   Fetches and parses `data.csv`.
*   Calculates the sum of the 'sales' column.
*   Displays the total sales prominently.
*   Responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.
*   Sets the document title dynamically.

## Setup and Usage

To run this application:

1.  Ensure you have the `data.csv` file in the same directory as `index.html`.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The application will automatically fetch `data.csv`, process the sales data, and display the total sales.
